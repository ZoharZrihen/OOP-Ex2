# About this project 
This project represent a way build a weighted directed graph and run algorithms on it.
This project has a advanced GUI class which can show\build your graph and run algorithms on it.

# The graph: 
* This graph is made of nodes(vertices) and edges.
* Each vertex has a key, the graph can't have duplicate values of keys.
* Each edge has positive value of weight.
* User can add nodes(vertices) and connect between them(creates a new edge).
* User can remove nodes\edges.

# Algorithms to implement on the graph
* IsConnected: Checks if the graph is strongly connected. (There is a path from every vertex to all other vertices).
* ShortestPathDis: Return the length of the shortest path between two vertices.
* ShortestPath: Return the shorest path itself between two vertices. 
* Save\init: Saves\initilaizing a graph to\from file. 
* TSP: This method get list of vertices and computes a relatively short path which visit each node in the targets List.just a simple path going over all nodes in the list.

# The Graphic user interface:
* The project contains an advanced GUI.
* It can draw you graph and run all Algorithms on it.
* User can build is graph from zero through the gui.
* User can load\save the graph through the gui.

# Tests
* This project contain a package of tests for each class, using JUnit4.
* Those tests are example for how to use all the classes and the methods of each class.
* The tests package also checks that everything is working well.
